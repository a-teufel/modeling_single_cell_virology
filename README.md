Estimation Software and Figure files for Uncovering modeling feature of viral replication dynamics

Included here is the parameter estimation framework developed for the manscript "Uncovering essential modeling features of viral replication dynamics from
single-cell virology experiments". The R package (kinda) is called spire (Single-cell Population Infection Replication Estimation). 

To make use of the package, download the spire directory then build and install the package. To build the package use the command “R CMD build spire” once the package is built, use the command “R CMD INSTALL spire_0.1.tar.gz” to install the package. 

An example of how to use the package is given is included in the "example" folder.
